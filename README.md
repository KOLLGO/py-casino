# PY-Casino - The casual gambling application
## Description
This python application includes three different slot machines and a wheel of fortune for casual gambling. More currency may be added whenever it is necessary. Saving the current account balance is not possible (yet), so the program will always start at 0.
## Origin Story
Gambling is fun. But gambling is also expensive. There are free apps out there, but you usually run out of currency or are talked into paying for special contents. The application aims to fix this. As you run out of currency, simply add more by the press of a button. No risk to lose any money, just some fun. <br>
I am currently building an arcade machine using [Retropie](https://retropie.org.uk). As this project is finished, I plan on using this application as a game on the machine (see [Retropie Setup](#retropie-setup)). Therefore, I wanted to keep the design in a retro-like pixel art style and the requirements as few as possible. I have also designed a theme to match the case design for my machine. If you run Retropie with Emulationstation on it, you might want to [check it out](https://github.com/KOLLGO/ES-Heatmap-Theme).

## Requirements
Python
First you need to install Python. Then run `pip install pygame` in your terminal to install pygame. After these two steps, you are good to go!
<br> <br>
The Versions used for programming the application (compare if there are any issues):
- Python Version: 3.11.0
- Pip Version: 24.2
- Pygame Version: 2.6.0
## Starting the Application
To start the application, navigate to the location of the `pycasino.py` file with your terminal using `cd path/to/file`. <br>
Then run `python3 pycasino.py` to start the application.
<br> <br>
Any other common way to start a python application works fine, too.
